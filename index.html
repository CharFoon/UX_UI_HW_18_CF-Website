        <p>I want to help raise a child. <br>

          “Excuse me?” you say. Stay with me here... <br><br>

          Remember that proverb, “It takes a village to raise a child?” Now if that village was a forward-thinking design team, made up of product managers, UX/UI designers, developers and stakeholders… and that child was a user-centred product, created to solve problems and enhance the end-user experience, then, yes! I’d like to be part of that proverbial village raising that child.”<br><br>

          You say, “It takes commitment.” 
          I say, “I’m in – hook, line and sinker!” <br><br>

          Optimistic. Empathetic. Passionate. Collaborative. Flexible. 5 words used to describe me. Not just in a professional capacity, but in a personal one too. Why am I telling you this? Because I believe that many of the values we hold as a person, carry over into our work too.<br><br>

          Design is first and foremost my interest and passion. Design in aesthetics and thinking. That’s why no matter which avenue I explore in life, it always brings me back to this. UX/UI Design has allowed me to embrace my creativity in a collaborative and meaningful way. </p>
